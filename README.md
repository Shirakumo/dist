About Shirakumo-Dist
--------------------
This is an application to help manage the Shirakumo [Quicklisp](http://www.quicklisp.org/) dist. It contains a number of tools for handling git repositories and a small wrapper around [Quickdist](https://github.com/orivej/quickdist) to run a dist. Some special changes apply for Shirakumo's libraries. You can probably extract most of the tools in here for your own purposes to create a quick and easy dist for your own systems.
